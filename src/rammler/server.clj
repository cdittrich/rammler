  "Handle incoming AMQP 0.9.1 connections

  From the specification:
  2.2.4 The Connection Class
  AMQP is a connected protocol. The connection is designed to be long-lasting, and can carry multiple
  channels. The connection life-cycle is this:
  - The client opens a TCP/IP connection to the server and sends a protocol header. This is the only data
  - the client sends that is not formatted as a method.
  - The server responds with its protocol version and other properties, including a list of the security
    mechanisms that it supports (the Start method).
  - The client selects a security mechanism (Start-Ok).
  - The server starts the authentication process, which uses the SASL challenge-response model. It sends
    the client a challenge (Secure).
  - The client sends an authentication response (Secure-Ok). For example using the \"plain\" mechanism,
    the response consist of a login name and password.
  - The server repeats the challenge (Secure) or moves to negotiation, sending a set of parameters such as
    maximum frame size (Tune).
  - The client accepts or lowers these parameters (Tune-Ok).
  - The client formally opens the connection and selects a virtual host (Open).
  - The server confirms that the virtual host is a valid choice (Open-Ok).
  - The client now uses the connection as desired.
  - One peer (client or server) ends the connection (Close).
  - The other peer hand-shakes the connection end (Close-Ok).
  - The server and the client close their socket connection.

  There is no hand-shaking for errors on connections that are not fully open. Following successful protocol
  header negotiation, which is defined in detail later, and prior to sending or receiving Open or Open-Ok, a
  peer that detects an error MUST close the socket without sending any further data."
