# rammler

rammler is an AMQP 0.9.1 proxy, the protocol implemented by recent
versions of the RabbitMQ message broker. Its main purpose is to
dispatch incoming client connections to different RabbitMQ servers
depending on the username the client tries to authenticate with. That
way, a topology of different servers can be used through a single
endpoint for clients.
